L/G ranges and defaults are different between Merkel and Demand Curve, should they be?
DDV_MinMaxDouble(pDX, m_dblMerkelLG, (ip min) 0.1, (ip max) 10.0, (is min) 0.1, (is max) 10.0, (decimal) 2)
DDV_MinMaxDouble(pDX, m_dblLg,                0.0,           5.0,          0.0,           5.0, 2);

Demand curve
Color of curves (all the same or multicolor or selectable)
Checkboxes in legend
slider
any benefit to seeing the values?

Psychrometrics should changing click automatically calculate
Should the calculation selection be on the top

MechanicalDraftPerformanceCurve
are the number of ranges ok
inputting design data, would it be easier to allow importing a cvs file?
How do you see all the test points? Wouldn't be better as a tab like the ranged data
Are there only 2 tests points? design and test
Can the test data units be different than design units?

if there is an error reading the file - one of the values is out of range, do you want to reset it to it default value?
when you change from ip to is do you want the values converted when reading file or convert the values already loaded?

Help Abbreviations there are * what does the * mean?

Would you like to save the data on other pages to a file?
