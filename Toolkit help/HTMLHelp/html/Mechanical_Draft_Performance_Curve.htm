 <P class="Block-Text" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0">&nbsp;</P>
 <P>The Cooling Technology Institute publishes its cooling tower test standard ATC-105 to standardize the testing of all types of cooling towers. This standard describes in detail the test methodology as well as the procedures to evaluate the collected data to determine the cooling tower capability. There are two methods for determining tower capability from collected test data: the characteristic curve method and the performance curve method. The characteristic curve method can be performed using the Demand Curve tab, along with appropriate data supplied by the manufacturer and field test data. The performance curve method can be performed using the Mechanical Draft Perf Curve tab, along with a set of performance curves supplied by the tower manufacturer or rebuilder and field test data. </P>
