  <P class="Block-Text" >Cross-plot 2 shows the predicted flow based on the test entering wet bulb temperature, test cooling range and test leaving water temperature. The horizontal line at the test leaving water temperature intersects the curve and yields the Predicted Flow rate. The predicted flow rate is the waterflow that the tower can cool to the test leaving water temperature at the test entering wet bulb temperature, test range.</P></LI>
