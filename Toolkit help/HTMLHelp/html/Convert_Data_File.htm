<h1>Converting Data File</h1>
<p>The data file format has changed. To be able to use your old data file, 
 they must be converted to the new format. Included in the Toolkit installation 
 is a data file converter. You can find the 'CTI Toolkit Data File Converter' 
 under 'CTI Toolkit&#160;4.0' folder on the start menu. </p>

<p>The data file converter will search for existing data files in known 
 locations. If your data files are stored in a different folder, use the 
 'Select' button next to the 'Input File Directory'.</p>
<p>The converted data files are stored in your Documents folder under 'Cooling 
 Technology Institute\CTI Toolkit 4.0'. If you prefer a different output 
 folder, use the 'Select' button next to the 'Output File Directory.</p>
<p>Once the directories are selected, click on 'Convert'.</p>
<p>The Input File Directory is a drop down list of all locations where 
 data files could be. To convert all the files, you must select each of 
 the Input File Directory and click on 'Convert'.</p>
